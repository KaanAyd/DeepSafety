# DeepSafety

In the realm of autonomous driving (AD) and advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS), the ability to accurately and efficiently recognize traffic signs is paramount. Traffic signs provide critical information about road conditions, regulations, and warnings, ensuring the safety and smooth operation of vehicles. Neural networks have shown significant promise in addressing this complex task due to their ability to learn and generalize from large datasets.
